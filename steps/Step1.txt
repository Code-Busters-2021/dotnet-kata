Welcome to the arena ! We want to develop a game where gladiators fight with each other

The actual solution contains :
- Gladiators class Library
 - - this is where you want to code your functionalities
- Gladiators.Tests test project
 - - this is where you want to write your unit tests
- Gladiators.ConsoleApp
 - - this is where you write your programs
- Gladiators.External
 - - Some code you cannot modify.
 
Step1 Requirements :
- A gladiator has a Name.
 - - Name | string,  must not be null nor empty, lenght between 3 to 15 chars
 
- A gladiator has HealthPoints.
 - - HealthPoints | integer,  must always be greater or equal to zero.

- A gladiator has Attack.
 - - Attack | integer,  must always be greater or equal to zero.
 
- A gladiator can deal damage
 - - returns damage | integer,  must always be greater or equal to zero.
 - - damage equals to Attack * attackModifier (rounded up to the next whole number).
 - - attackModifier being a rolled value from 0.8 to 1.2 using a uniform distribution


- A gladiator can take damage
 - - param damage | integer,  must always be greater or equal to zero.
 - - taking damages reduces HealthPoints by its amount
 
- When a gladiator HealthPoints reaches zero, he dies.
 - - IsDead boolean
 
Step 1 Instructions :
Following requirements : Write a program that creates a gladiator. Make him receive damages until he dies
 

Instructions Reminder :
Use exactly one commit for each step
Your code should follow clean code best practices
Your code should be unit tested (100% Coverage)
Your branch should be named following this pattern "kata/<firstname_lastname>"
